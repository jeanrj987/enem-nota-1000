# Senior Development Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the workflow, standards, and patterns for delivering production-grade software across web, backend, mobile, and platform work. Use it when planning implementation, making architecture tradeoffs, improving code quality, or shipping safely.

## Delivery Workflow

### 1. Understand the problem
- Clarify goals, constraints, success metrics, deadlines, and non-goals. If any of these are missing, ask before writing code — never assume.
- Identify unknowns: if >2 unknowns exist, add a spike task (max 2 hours, concrete deliverable) before committing to an estimate.
- Propose a minimal viable technical approach first. If the approach requires >5 days of work, look for a simpler alternative or split into phases.
- Define acceptance criteria before implementation. Every criterion must be verifiable — "works correctly" is not a criterion; "returns 200 with JWT containing user_id claim" is.

### 2. Plan implementation
- Break work into small, testable milestones. Each milestone must be mergeable independently — if milestone B cannot ship without milestone A, they are one milestone.
- If a change touches >5 files, write a 1-paragraph plan before starting. If >15 files, write a design doc (see references/design-docs.md).
- Plan rollback: every database migration must be reversible. If a migration drops a column, first deploy code that stops reading it, then drop in the next release.
- For any new external dependency (API, service, database), define: timeout (default 5s), retry policy (3 attempts, exponential backoff), circuit breaker threshold (5 failures in 60s), and fallback behavior.

### 3. Implement and verify
- Functions >40 lines: split. Files >300 lines: split. If a function takes >4 parameters, introduce a config/options object.
- Test at the right level: pure logic = unit test. API endpoints = integration test. Critical user flows = E2E test (max 5 E2E tests per feature — they are slow and flaky).
- Every new API endpoint must have: input validation (Zod/Pydantic/class-validator), error response schema, rate limit, and at least one integration test.
- Every database query on a table with >10k rows must have an index. Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE and reject sequential scans on large tables.
- Never catch an error and swallow it silently. Log it with context (operation, input, correlation ID) or re-throw. Catch only errors you can handle.
- Backward compatibility: if changing a shared type or API response shape, grep all consumers. If >0 consumers depend on the old shape, use expand-migrate-contract (add new field, migrate consumers, remove old field).

### 4. Ship and stabilize
- Before merging: run the full test suite locally, verify no lint/type errors, check bundle size / binary size if applicable.
- Deploy with observability: every deploy must be visible in metrics within 5 minutes. If you cannot tell from a dashboard whether the deploy is healthy, add instrumentation before deploying.
- After deploy: monitor error rates and p95 latency for 30 minutes. If error rate increases >2x or p95 doubles, roll back immediately — do not debug in production first.
- Capture tech debt within 48 hours of discovering it. Each debt item must have: description, impact (latency/reliability/developer velocity), estimated effort, and owner. Unowned debt does not get fixed.

## Engineering Standards
- Every API endpoint must document: request/response schema, error codes with meanings, authentication requirement, and rate limit. If an endpoint lacks this, it is not ready for review.
- Every database migration must be tested with rollback on a copy of production data (or realistic seed data) before merging. Migrations that take >30s on production-size data must be run as background jobs, not blocking deploys.
- Every critical path (auth, payment, core CRUD) must have: latency histogram, error rate counter, and an alert that fires when p95 exceeds 2x the baseline or error rate exceeds 1%.
- Security is not a follow-up task. Auth checks, input validation, and CSRF protection are part of the initial implementation. If a PR adds an endpoint without auth, it is not ready for review.
- Performance budgets: API response p95 <200ms for reads, <500ms for writes. If a new feature exceeds these, optimize before merging — not after.

## Anti-Pattern Detection
When reviewing or writing code, flag and fix these immediately:
- **N+1 queries:** Loop that makes a database call per iteration. Fix with batch query, JOIN, or DataLoader.
- **Unbounded queries:** `SELECT *` or query without LIMIT on a user-facing endpoint. Always paginate, always select only needed columns.
- **Shared mutable state:** Global variable modified by multiple request handlers. Use request-scoped context or dependency injection.
- **Stringly-typed code:** Using raw strings for status, type, or role values. Use enums or union types.
- **God function:** Function that handles parsing, validation, business logic, database, and response formatting. Split into layers.
- **Missing error context:** `catch (e) { throw new Error("failed") }`. Always include the original error and operation context.
- **Premature abstraction:** Creating a generic framework for something used in one place. Wait until the pattern repeats 3 times.
- **Config in code:** Hardcoded URLs, API keys, feature flags, or environment-specific values. Move to environment variables or config service.

## Technology Selection Decision Rules

### Language Selection
- **Go**: Choose when the service is I/O-bound with high concurrency (>10k concurrent connections), needs single-binary deployment, or is infrastructure tooling (CLI, proxy, sidecar). Avoid for rapid prototyping or heavy ORM usage.
- **Node.js (TypeScript)**: Choose when the team is full-stack JS, the service is a BFF (Backend for Frontend), real-time features dominate (WebSocket, SSE), or the ecosystem has a mature library for the domain. Avoid for CPU-bound processing (image/video, ML inference).
- **Python**: Choose when the domain is data/ML, the team is Python-native, or rapid iteration matters more than runtime performance. Avoid for latency-sensitive services (<10ms p95 target) unless using FastAPI with uvloop.
- **Java/Kotlin**: Choose when the organization has JVM expertise, needs mature enterprise libraries (Spring, Hibernate), or requires strong typing with high throughput. Avoid for small services where JVM startup time (2-5s) exceeds acceptable cold start.
- **Rust**: Choose only when the service has hard latency requirements (<1ms p99), processes untrusted input at scale, or is a performance-critical library. The 2-3x development time multiplier must be justified by a specific, measured need.

### Database Selection (Quick Reference)
- **PostgreSQL** (default): Use for any relational data <10TB. Supports JSON, full-text search, and geospatial — eliminate the need for a second database when possible.
- **Redis**: Use for caching (TTL <24h), session storage, rate limiting, or real-time leaderboards. Never as primary data store — data loss on restart is expected.
- **MongoDB**: Use only when schema genuinely varies per document (CMS, event stores with polymorphic payloads). If you can define a schema upfront, use PostgreSQL.
- **SQLite**: Use for CLI tools, mobile apps, embedded systems, or local-first apps. If >1 process writes concurrently, use PostgreSQL.

### API Style Selection
- **REST**: Default choice. Use for CRUD-dominant APIs, public APIs, or when caching matters (HTTP caching works natively).
- **GraphQL**: Use only when the client needs flexible field selection across >5 entity types AND the frontend team controls the schema. If <3 entity types, REST is simpler. Never use GraphQL for server-to-server communication.
- **gRPC**: Use for internal service-to-service communication when latency <5ms matters, streaming is required, or strong contract enforcement across >3 languages is needed. Never expose gRPC directly to browsers without a gateway.
- **tRPC**: Use when frontend and backend share a TypeScript monorepo. Gives end-to-end type safety with zero schema duplication. Not suitable for multi-language backends.

## Estimation Decision Rules

### Task Estimation by Type
- **CRUD endpoint** (route + validation + DB query + tests): 2-4 hours. If it needs pagination, filtering, and sorting: add 2 hours.
- **CRUD endpoint with auth + rate limiting + caching**: 1 day.
- **Third-party API integration** (OAuth, webhook, SDK): 1-2 days. Always double the estimate if the third-party documentation is poor — verify by reading it before estimating.
- **Database migration** (add column, add index): 1-2 hours if table <1M rows. If >1M rows, add 4 hours for online migration tooling and testing.
- **Database migration** (schema redesign, data backfill): 2-3 days including dual-write period and verification.
- **New service from scratch** (repo + CI/CD + health checks + first endpoint + monitoring): 3-5 days.
- **Authentication system** (signup + login + password reset + session management): 3-5 days with a proven library (NextAuth, Passport, Django auth). 2-3 weeks if building custom — strongly discourage.
- **File upload/download** (presigned URLs + validation + storage): 1-2 days.
- **Real-time feature** (WebSocket/SSE + connection management + reconnection): 2-3 days.
- **Search** (full-text across >3 fields with filtering): 1 day with PostgreSQL tsvector, 2-3 days with Elasticsearch.

### Estimation Multipliers
- First time using a library/framework: 2x the estimate.
- Legacy codebase with no tests: 1.5x (you must write tests to verify your change).
- Multi-timezone or i18n requirement: 1.3x.
- Compliance requirement (audit logging, encryption, access controls): 1.5x.
- If the estimate exceeds 5 days, break into sub-tasks and estimate each. If any sub-task exceeds 3 days, it is too large — break further.

## Refactoring Decision Rules

### When to Refactor
- **Cyclomatic complexity >15** (measure with `scripts/review_checklist.py` or ESLint `complexity` rule): Extract branches into named functions. Each function should have complexity <10.
- **Function called from >5 call sites with different flag combinations**: Replace boolean flags with strategy pattern or separate functions. `processOrder(order, true, false, true)` is unreadable — split into `processStandardOrder()`, `processExpressOrder()`.
- **Identical code block appears 3+ times**: Extract to a shared function. At 2 occurrences, tolerate duplication — premature abstraction is worse than duplication.
- **Module has >10 imports from other modules**: High coupling. Introduce a facade or reorganize module boundaries so each module imports from at most 5 others.
- **Test requires >20 lines of setup**: The code under test has too many dependencies. Inject dependencies and provide test doubles. If you cannot test a function without starting a database, the function does too much.
- **Changing one feature requires modifying >5 files across >2 directories**: Shotgun surgery. Consolidate related logic into a single module or introduce a feature module pattern.

### When NOT to Refactor
- Code is stable, untouched for >6 months, and has no pending feature work. Leave it alone.
- You are refactoring to match a style preference, not to fix a measurable problem (complexity, coupling, test difficulty). Stop.
- The refactor would require >3 days and there is no feature work that benefits from it. Defer and document as tech debt.

## Code Review Decision Rules

### By Pattern Detected
- **New database query without EXPLAIN ANALYZE output**: Request it. No query merges without execution plan on production-like data volume.
- **New endpoint without error response test**: Block. Every endpoint must be tested with: valid input (200), missing auth (401), forbidden (403), and invalid input (400).
- **Catch block that logs and continues**: Verify the function can actually recover. If it cannot, re-throw. Catching + logging + continuing hides bugs until they cascade.
- **Function with >3 levels of nesting**: Request extraction of inner blocks into named functions. Deep nesting signals logic that should be inverted (early returns) or decomposed.
- **Magic numbers/strings**: Request named constants. `if (retries > 3)` → `if (retries > MAX_RETRIES)`. Exception: 0, 1, and common HTTP status codes (200, 404, 500).
- **TODO/FIXME without issue link**: Block. Every TODO must reference a ticket. Untracked TODOs never get fixed and rot.
- **Test that asserts only `toBeTruthy()` or `not.toThrow()`**: Weak assertion. Request specific value assertions. A test that passes when the output is wrong is worse than no test.
- **New dependency added**: Check: bundle size impact (run `bundlesize` or equivalent), last commit date, download count, license compatibility, and whether a stdlib solution exists. Block if the dependency adds >50KB to the bundle for a feature that could be built in <2 hours.

## Architecture Guidance
- If the team is <5 engineers, use a monolith. If 5-15, use a modular monolith with clear domain modules. If >15 with independent release cycles, consider service extraction.
- Keep boundaries explicit between domain logic, data access, and transport layers. If domain logic imports HTTP request types or database client types, the boundary is violated.
- When adding a new dependency (library, service, or tool): check last commit date (reject if >12 months inactive), weekly downloads (reject if <1k for JS, <500 for Python), and open security advisories.
- Use feature flags for changes that affect >1000 users or involve new infrastructure. Roll out to 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% with 24-hour soak at each stage.
- Record architecture decisions (ADRs) for: new external dependencies, database schema changes, API contract changes, infrastructure changes, and technology choices. An ADR that takes >10 minutes to write is too long.

## Self-Verification Protocol
After completing any implementation, run this checklist before considering the task done:
- Run the full test suite. Zero failures. If a test you did not touch fails, verify it also fails on main — if it does not, your change broke it.
- For every new API endpoint, make a real HTTP request (curl or integration test) and verify the response matches the documented schema field-by-field.
- For every database migration, run forward AND rollback on a fresh database and on production-like seed data. Both directions must succeed.
- After refactoring, diff test outputs before/after. If any behavior changed unintentionally, the refactor introduced a bug — revert and redo.
- Check that no `console.log`, `print()`, `debugger`, or `TODO` statements remain in production code paths.
- Verify that every new dependency passes the health check: last commit <12 months, downloads >1k/week (JS) or >500/week (Python), zero open critical CVEs.
- If the change affects a user-facing flow, manually walk through it end-to-end in the browser/app. Automation catches regressions — manual testing catches UX issues.

## Failure Recovery
- **Build fails after your change**: Read the full error — not just the last line. If it is a type error, fix it. If it is a test failure in code you did not touch, run `git stash && npm test` to verify it fails on main too. If it does, pre-existing; if not, your change broke it.
- **Test passes locally, fails in CI**: Check environment differences — Node/Python version, missing env vars, timezone, OS case sensitivity, or Docker vs host filesystem. Never `skip` a CI test — fix the root cause.
- **Approach not working after 2 hours**: Stop. Write: (1) what you tried, (2) why it failed, (3) what assumption was wrong. Identify the simplest alternative. If none exists, escalate with a concrete blocker description.
- **Performance regression after deploy**: Roll back first, investigate second. Never debug performance in production while users are affected.
- **Merge conflict on large PR**: If >5 files conflict, do not resolve blindly. Re-read both sides of every conflict. If the other branch changed the same function, test both behaviors after resolution.
- **Dependency upgrade breaks things**: Pin the working version, file an issue with exact error, move on. Do not spend >1 hour on a third-party regression.
- **Flaky test blocking merge**: Run it 5 times locally. If it fails inconsistently, it has a race condition or timing dependency. Fix the test (add proper waits, mock time, remove shared state) — never retry-until-pass.
